Summary of the DriverPass Project

The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted an online system to help users prepare for their driver’s license exams. The client requested a system that would allow students to register, access driving lessons and practice tests, schedule appointments with instructors, and track their progress. The goal was to make learning to drive more accessible and efficient through a single online platform.

What I Did Well

I did particularly well in clearly identifying the system’s main users and mapping out their interactions through the use case and activity diagrams. These diagrams helped show how the system would function in a simple, easy-to-understand way for both technical and non-technical audiences.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the class diagram. I would make the relationships between classes clearer and include more details about data attributes and methods. This would strengthen the link between the system’s structure and its functionality.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on what the client wanted the system to accomplish—making it simple for students to register, study, and schedule lessons. I translated these needs into specific system features like account management, secure login, and online test preparation. Considering user needs is essential because a system is only successful if it is intuitive, reliable, and solves real problems for its users.

Approach to Designing Software

When designing software, I start by gathering detailed requirements from the client and identifying user goals. I then use diagrams and models—such as use case, activity, and class diagrams—to plan how the system will work. In the future, I would also use techniques like user feedback sessions, prototypes, and iterative design to ensure the system continues to meet user expectations as it develops.
